## Features

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Manchester, where I work on observational cosmology, with a focus on 
* radio cosmology (HI intensity mapping, global 21cm sinal, Epoch of Reionisation tomography) and 
* low-frequency foreground science (AME, RSB excess, high-dynamic-range behavior of the spectrum, Polarisation and Faraday rotation, etc.). 

<p>
My research interests include the formalisation of detailed astrophysical processes and general observational effects (instrumental, dynamical, topological, etc) for cosmological observations, and the development of methods and tools to characterise them. 
</p>

<p>
Recently, I have been fascinated by the use of perturbative statistical methods to study the foreground components and the cosmological 21cm signal, as well as ultra-high dimensional Bayesian inference using the Gibbs sampling method.
