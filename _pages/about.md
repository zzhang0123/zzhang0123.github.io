## Features

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at JBCA, the University of Manchester, where I work on observational cosmology, with a focus on 
* radio cosmology (HI intensity mapping, global 21cm sinal, Epoch of Reionisation tomography) and 
* low-frequency foreground science (AME, RSB excess, high-dynamic-range behavior of the spectrum, Polarisation and Faraday rotation, etc.). 

<p>
My research focuses on formalizing detailed astrophysical processes and accounting for various observational effects — instrumental, dynamical, modified radiative tranfer, topological, and more — in cosmological observations. I also work on developing methods and tools to accurately characterize these effects.
Recently, I have been fascinated by the use of perturbative statistical methods to understanding and characterising the ensemble behaviour of the models of astrophysical and cosmological processes, as well as ultra-high dimensional Bayesian inference using the Gibbs sampling method. As both a theorist and an observer, my approach is to model physical processes with high accuracy, while abstracting out as many environmental effects as possible. Methodologically, my goal is to fit models and summary statistics of systematic environmental effects through large joint posterior distribution functions.
</p>


<p>
In addition to the areas mentioned, I continue to explore gravitational observations, the topology of the Universe, and the transition from quantum to classical fields on cosmic scales—particularly quantum decoherence effects. Recently, in my spare time, I've been envisioning the development of a coordinate-free approach to cosmology.
