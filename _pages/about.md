## Who I am and what I'm doing now

I am Zheng Zhang, currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at JBCA, University of Manchester. My work focuses on observational cosmology, especially formalising detailed astrophysical processes and accounting for various observational effects -- instrumental, dynamical, radiative transfer, geometrical, topological, and more -- in cosmological observations. I also develop methods and tools to accurately characterise these effects.

**Research interests include:**
- **Observational cosmology**
  - HI intensity mapping, global 21cm history, and Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) tomography
  - The role of polarisation in 21cm surveys
  - Low-frequency foreground science
    - Diffuse synchrotron emission (spectral structure, Faraday rotation, RSB/ARCADE excess, etc.)
    - Spinning dust emission and Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME)
  - Cosmic Microwave Background
    - Lensing B-modes and foregrounds from spinning dust grains
- **Stochastic processes in astrophysics**
  - Non-equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium astrophysical systems
  - Stochastic instrumental processes (e.g., 1/f noise in autocorrelation measurements)
  - Statistical measurements
  - Methods: Fokker-Planck equations, analytical diffusion systems, Langevin equations, and stochastic differential equations
- **Simulation and analysis**
  - Ultra-high-dimensional Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling
  - Perturbative statistical analysis
    - Marginalising and abstracting out ignorance or environmental factors
    - Using moment and cumulant expansions
  - Machine Learning
    - MomentEmu (my proposed non-regression approach to smooth mapping representation)
    - Deep Learning
    - Physics-driven methods (e.g., PDE-net)

In addition to these areas, I have active research interests in gravitational phenomena and their observational signatures, cosmological topology, and the quantum-to-classical transition of fields on cosmic scales.

## More about me

### Bio
- **Pronouns:** He/Him  
- **Title:** PhD in Physics of the Universe (DOCTORAT PHYSIQUE DE L'UNIVERS)  
- **Marital Status:** Married  
- **Nationality:** Chinese  
- **Location:** Manchester, United Kingdom  
- **Profile:** Astrophysicist and cosmologist; self-proclaimed “citizen of the Universe.”

### Life and Education Journey
I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Manchester, working with Phil Bull and Jens Chluba. Previously, I completed my PhD in Physics of the Universe at the Astroparticle and Cosmology (APC) Laboratory, Université Paris Cité, jointly with the École Normale Supérieure (ENS, Paris), from **November 2020 to October 2023** in **Paris, France**.

Before that, I earned an MSc in Physics from Brown University (**2018–2020, Rhode Island, US**) and a BSc in Applied Physics from Shanghai University (**2014–2018, Shanghai, China**). My earlier education includes high school in **Hai’an** and primary school in Sunzhuang village (**2002–2014**). I was born in 1996.

### Scientific Ancestry 

Below is my academic tree, illustrating the lineage from doctoral supervisors to students.

### Students

- Pranav Odugoudar (MSc student, University of Manchester)
- Tong Lu (Undergraduate student, University of Manchester)

### Biological Ancestry

I can't go back too far. My grandfather was adopted. The man who adopted him, my great-grandfather, was a tofu maker/seller in the village, but unfortunately the craft was not passed on.

###  The Home Team

Our little family includes my wife and myself, our Bengal cat, Youzi, along with two cherished baobab trees, Jumbo and Zhuangzhuang, which we brought with us from Paris to Manchester. While living in the US, I raised a loving German Shepherd named Summer, who now enjoys life with my parents in my faraway hometown.
