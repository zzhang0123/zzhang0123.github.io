## What I'm doing now 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at JBCA, the University of Manchester, where I work on observational cosmology, with a focus on 
* radio cosmology (HI intensity mapping, global 21cm sinal, Epoch of Reionisation tomography) and 
* low-frequency foreground science (AME, RSB excess, high-dynamic-range behavior of the spectrum, Polarisation and Faraday rotation, etc.). 


<p>
My research focuses on formalizing detailed astrophysical processes and accounting for various observational effects — instrumental, dynamical, modified radiative tranfer, topological, and more — in cosmological observations. I also work on developing methods and tools to accurately characterize these effects.
Recently, I have been fascinated by the use of perturbative statistical methods to understanding and characterising the ensemble behaviour of the models of astrophysical and cosmological processes, as well as ultra-high dimensional Bayesian inference using the Gibbs sampling method. As both a theorist and an observer, my approach is to model physical processes with high accuracy, while abstracting out as many environmental effects as possible. Methodologically, my goal is to fit models and summary statistics of systematic environmental effects through large joint posterior distribution functions.
</p>


<p>
In addition to the areas mentioned, I continue to explore gravitational observations, the topology of the Universe, and the transition from quantum to classical fields on cosmic scales—particularly quantum decoherence effects. Recently, in my spare time, I've been envisioning the development of a coordinate-free approach to cosmology.

## More about me


### Bio
**Pronouns**: He/Him

**Title**: Dr.

**Marital Status**: Married to Yuyan Huang

**Nationality**: Chinese

**Personal Interests**: A passionate dog lover, nature person, and self-proclaimed “citizen of the Universe”

**Location**: Manchester, United Kingdom

### Life and Education Journey
I completed my PhD in Physics of the Universe at the Astroparticle and Cosmology (APC) Laboratory, Université Paris Cité, from November 2020 to October 2023. During the first half of the program, I was based at the École Normale Supérieure (ENS, Paris).
Prior to that, I earned my MSc in Physics from Brown University (2018–2020) and my undergraduate degree in Applied Physics from Shanghai University (2014–2018). My earlier education includes high school in Hai’an and primary school in Sunzhuang village, spanning from 2002 to 2014. I was born in 1996.

### More

- The Home Team

Our little family includes myself and my wife, Mrs. Huang Yuyan, along with two cherished baobab trees, Jumbo and Zhuangzhuang (壮壮), which we brought with us from Paris to Manchester. While living in the US, I raised a loving and loyal German Shepherd named Summer, who now enjoys life with my parents in my faraway hometown in China.

- Academic Gossips 

My PhD supervisor Martin once told me that he and I have Italian ancestry in academia, and Nick, who is also my supervisor, once commented that my style is what Weinberg is good at - playing the violin with boxing gloves. This inspired my interest in studying academic gossip (or academic lineage, if you prefer)!
