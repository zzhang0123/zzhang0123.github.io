    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Manchester, where I work on observational cosmology, with a focus on radio cosmology (HI intensity mapping, global 21cm sinal, Epoch of Reionisation tomography, etc) and low-frequency foreground science (AME, RSB excess, high-dynamic-range spectrum, etc). 
    </p>
    <p>
    My research interests include the formalisation of detailed astrophysical processes and general observational effects (dynamic and topological) for different observations, and the development of methods and tools to characterise them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Recently, I have been fascinated by the use of a variety of perturbative statistical methods to study the foreground components and the cosmological 21cm signal, as well as ultra-high dimensional Bayesian inference using the Gibbs sampling method.
