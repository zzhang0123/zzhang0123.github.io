## What I'm doing now 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at JBCA, the University of Manchester, where I work on observational cosmology, with a focus on 
- Radio cosmology 
  - HI intensity mapping, global 21cm history, and Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) tomography.  
  - Role of polarisation in 21cm surveys.
- Low-frequency foreground science 
  - Diffuse synchrotron emission (spectral sturcture, Faraday rotation, etc.).
  - Spinning dust emission
  - Anomalies 
    - Anormalous Microwave Emission (AME) and Radio Synchrotron Background (RSB) excess.
  - Perturbative statistical analysis 
  	- Using moment expansion, cumulant expansion, etc.
- Stochastic processes in astrophysics
  - Non-equilibrium system (interested in the emergent statistical laws from BBGKY)
  - 1/f noise in autocorrelation measurements.
  - Fokker-Planck equations and diffusion systems...
- Physics-Driven Machine Learning
  - Symbolic regression
  - PDE net


<p>
Specifically, my research interest is in formalising detailed astrophysical processes and accounting for various observational effects - instrumental, dynamical, modified radiative transfer, geometrical and topological, and more - in cosmological observations. I also work on the development of methods and tools to accurately characterise these effects.
Recently, I have been fascinated by the use of perturbative statistical methods to understanding and characterising the ensemble behaviour of the models of astrophysical and cosmological processes, as well as ultra-high dimensional Bayesian inference using the Gibbs sampling method. As both a theorist and an observer, my approach to science extraction is to model physical processes with high accuracy, while abstracting out as many environmental effects as possible. Methodologically, my goal is to fit models and summary statistics of systematic environmental effects through large joint posterior distribution functions.

<p>
In addition to these areas, I have active research interests in gravitational phenomena and their observational signatures, cosmological topology, and the quantum to classical transition of fields on cosmic scales. Beyond formal research, I have a long-standing interest in developing a coordinate-free mathematical framework for cosmological analysis, with the aim of creating more universal tools for modelling cosmic phenomena.

## More about me


### Bio
**Pronouns**: He/Him

**Title**: Doctorate in the physics of the universe (DOCTORAT PHYSIQUE DE L'UNIVERS)

**Marital Status**: Married

**Nationality**: Chinese

**Location**: Manchester, United Kingdom

**Profile**: Dog lover, nature person, and self-proclaimed “citizen of the Universe”


### Life and Education Journey
I completed my PhD in Physics of the Universe at the Astroparticle and Cosmology (APC) Laboratory, Université Paris Cité, from November 2020 to October 2023. During the first half of the program, I was based at the École Normale Supérieure (ENS, Paris).
Prior to that, I earned my MSc in Physics from Brown University (2018–2020) and my undergraduate degree in Applied Physics from Shanghai University (2014–2018). My earlier education includes high school in Hai’an and primary school in Sunzhuang village, spanning from 2002 to 2014. I was born in 1996.

### Scientific Ancestry 

Here is the 'academic tree', with the arrows showing the relationship from the doctoral supervisor to the student.

### Students

- Pranav Odugoudar (MSc student; supervised by Phil Bull, co-supervised by me)

### Biological Ancestry

I can't go back too far. My grandfather was adopted. The man who adopted him, my great-grandfather, was a tofu maker/seller in the village, but unfortunately the craft was not passed on.

###  The Home Team

Our little family includes my wife and myself, our Bengal cat, Youzi, along with two cherished baobab trees, Jumbo and Zhuangzhuang, which we brought with us from Paris to Manchester. While living in the US, I raised a loving German Shepherd named Summer, who now enjoys life with my parents in my faraway hometown.
