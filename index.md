# Hi, there!

This is Zheng Zhang's personal website. I’m an astrophysicist and cosmologist.

This space also serves as my blog, where I share notes, ideas, and reflections on various topics.

## About Me
<section id="about">
<img src="{{ "/assets/images/zzhang1.jpg" | relative_url }}" alt="Zheng Zhang's Photo" class="profile-photo">
   I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Manchester, where I work on observational cosmology, with a focus on radio cosmology (HI intensity mapping, global 21cm sinal, Epoch of Reionisation tomography, etc) and low-frequency foreground science (AME, RSB excess, high-dynamic-range spectrum, etc). My research interests include the formalisation of detailed astrophysical processes and general observational effects (dynamic and topological) for different observations, and the development of methods and tools to characterise them. 

   Recently, I have been fascinated by the use of a variety of perturbative statistical methods to study the foreground components and the cosmological 21cm signal, as well as ultra-high dimensional Bayesian inference using the Gibbs sampling method.
