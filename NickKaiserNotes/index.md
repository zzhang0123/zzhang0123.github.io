<h3>Maintainer's Note</h3>

<p> Before he passed away, Nick was not only enjoying his retirement but also organizing his lecture notes. He had expressed to me that he hoped to sort them out and make them available to the public online. In particular, he felt that the world might need another textbook on General Relativity.
</p>

<p>
Although he obviously intended to present a more polished version, unfortunately we never had the chance to see it. 
These lectures reflect his constant reflection and refinement, from his time in Toronto to Hawaii and finally to Paris.
</p>


<p>
I may be the one who understands this wish best, who also realises the great value of these lecture notes. 
I hope I won't be the last student to benefit from these materials, so I'm sharing all of his lecture notes with you. 
This is the online archive of Nick's lectures and I will do my best to maintain these notes.
</p>

<p>
Should you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. You can visit my contact details directly at the root domain of this site.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
</p>

PS: Some of the notes are scans of the materials I saved, and there are some scribbles that may make them a bit untidy. I apologize if this causes any inconvenience.
